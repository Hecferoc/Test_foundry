To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">charm person</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">charm person</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Spellcasting Ability</span></h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Druid","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":800000,"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":166,"dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4,"class":"Druid"}}},"img":"https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_nature_wispsplode.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"FBNrSkjCJn2JJYSI","name":"Druid Circle","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.

Transforming doesn&rsquo;t break your concentration on a spell you&rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as [spell]<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning[/spell]</span>, that you&rsquo;ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, <span class=\"No-Break\">and heart.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn.

If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Harpers: </span></strong>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harper<span class=\"No-Break\">s’ ideals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Order of the Gauntlet:</strong> </span>One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s pa<span class=\"No-Break\">tron gods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong> </span>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods <span class=\"No-Break\">of nature.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Lords’ Alliance:</strong> </span>On one level, the agents of the Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span class=\"No-Break\">’s ideals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Zhentarim:</strong> </span>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the <span class=\"No-Break\">Zhentarim.</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</strong> </p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures.

These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, <span class=\"No-Break\">and heart.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own.

If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Harpers: </span></strong>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harper<span class=\"No-Break\">s’ ideals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Order of the Gauntlet:</strong> </span>One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s pa<span class=\"No-Break\">tron gods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong> </span>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods <span class=\"No-Break\">of nature.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Lords’ Alliance:</strong> </span>On one level, the agents of the Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span class=\"No-Break\">’s ideals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Zhentarim:</strong> </span>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the <span class=\"No-Break\">Zhentarim.</span></p>\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</strong> </p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.

If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.

These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, <span class=\"No-Break\">and heart.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faer&ucirc;n.

If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Harpers:&nbsp;</span></strong>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harper<span class=\"No-Break\">s’ ideals.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Order of the Gauntlet:</strong>&nbsp;</span>One of the newest power groups in Faer&ucirc;n, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s pa<span class=\"No-Break\">tron gods.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods <span class=\"No-Break\">of nature.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Lords’ Alliance:</strong>&nbsp;</span>On one level, the agents of the Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span class=\"No-Break\">’s ideals.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Zhentarim:</strong>&nbsp;</span>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the <span class=\"No-Break\">Zhentarim.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information.

These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, <span class=\"No-Break\">and heart.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faer&ucirc;n.

If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span class=\"No-Break\">ibilities.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Harpers:&nbsp;</span></strong>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harper<span class=\"No-Break\">s’ ideals.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Order of the Gauntlet:</strong>&nbsp;</span>One of the newest power groups in Faer&ucirc;n, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s pa<span class=\"No-Break\">tron gods.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods <span class=\"No-Break\">of nature.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Lords’ Alliance:</strong>&nbsp;</span>On one level, the agents of the Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span class=\"No-Break\">’s ideals.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"><strong>Zhentarim:</strong>&nbsp;</span>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the <span class=\"No-Break\">Zhentarim.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures.

It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p><p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p><p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p><p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p><p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":"full","damage":{"parts":[]}},"sort":4900000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1stlevel wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.

This is the sound of the sahuagin hunting horn &mdash; a call to raid and battle. Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as &ldquo;sea devils,&rdquo; for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Devils of the Deep.</strong></em> Sahuagin are a predatory, piscine race that ventures from the ocean&rsquo;s black depths to hunt the creatures of the shallows and shore. Though they dwell in the deepest trenches of the ocean, sahuagin view the entire aquatic realm as their kingdom and the creatures in it as blood sport for their hunting parties.</p>\r\n<p>The self-styled rulers of sahuagin ocean domains are massive mutant males that grow second sets of arms. They are terrible foes in battle, and all sahuagin bow down before these powerful barons.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Way of the Shark.</strong></em> Sahuagin worship the shark god Sekolah. Only female sahuagin are deemed worthy of channeling the god&rsquo;s power, and priestesses hold tremendous sway in sahuagin communities.</p>\r\n<p>Sahuagin are driven into a frenzy by the smell of fresh blood. As worshipers of Sekolah, they also have a special kinship with sharks, which they train as attack animals. Even untrained sharks recognize sahuagin as allies and don&rsquo;t prey on them.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Elven Enmity.</strong></em> The sahuagin might control the oceans if not for the presence of their mortal enemies, the aquatic elves. Wars between the two races have raged for centuries across the coasts and seas of the world, disrupting maritime trade and drawing other races into the bloody conflict.</p>\r\n<p>So intense is sahuagin hatred for the aquatic elves that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a malenti &mdash; a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way. Sahuagin are prone to mutation, but whether this rare phenomenon is a result of the wars between the sahuagin and the aquatic elves &mdash; or whether it preceded or even began the conflict &mdash; none can say.</p>\r\n<p>The sahuagin put the malenti to good use as spies and assassins in aquatic elf cities and the societies of other creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin. The mere shadow of the malenti threat incites paranoia and suspicion among aquatic elves, whose resilience is weakened as the prelude to an actual sahuagin

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.

You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Firearm Properties</strong></h5>\r\n<p>Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Ammunition</strong></h5>\r\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</p>\r\n<h5>Firearms</h5>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Name</th>\r\n<th>Cost</th>\r\n<th>Ammo</th>\r\n<th>Damage</th>\r\n<th>Weight</th>\r\n<th>Range</th>\r\n<th>Properties</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Palm Pistol</td>\r\n<td>50g</td>\r\n<td>2g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\r\n<td>1 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(40/160)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>Light, reload 1, misfire 1</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Pistol</td>\r\n<td>150g</td>\r\n<td>4g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\r\n<td>3 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(60/240)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 4, misfire 1</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Musket</td>\r\n<td>300g</td>\r\n<td>5g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d12 piercing</td>\r\n<td>10 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(120/480)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 2</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Pepperbox</td>\r\n<td>250g</td>\r\n<td>4g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\r\n<td>5 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(80/320)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 6, misfire 2</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Blunderbuss</td>\r\n<td>300g</td>\r\n<td>5g (5)</td>\r\n<td>2d8 piercing</td>\r\n<td>10 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(15/60)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 2</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Bad News</td>\r\n<td>Crafted</td>\r\n<td>10g (5)</td>\r\n<td>2d12 piercing</td>\r\n<td>25 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(200/800)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 3</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Hand Mortar</td>\r\n<td>Crafted</td>\r\n<td>10g (1)</td>\r\n<td>2d8 fire</td>\r\n<td>10 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(30/60)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 3, explosive</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Fighter : Gunslinger","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":800000,"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":39826,"dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":3,"displayOrder":2,"class":"Fighter : Gunslinger"}}},"img":"/icons/weapons/guns/gun-worn-steel.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"D0glSXGRmiKoNfVl","name":"Quickdraw","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you reach 7th level, you add your proficiency bonus to your initiative.

You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Firearm Properties</strong></h5>\r\n<p>Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Ammunition</strong></h5>\r\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</p>\r\n<h5>Firearms</h5>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Name</th>\r\n<th>Cost</th>\r\n<th>Ammo</th>\r\n<th>Damage</th>\r\n<th>Weight</th>\r\n<th>Range</th>\r\n<th>Properties</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Palm Pistol</td>\r\n<td>50g</td>\r\n<td>2g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\r\n<td>1 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(40/160)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>Light, reload 1, misfire 1</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Pistol</td>\r\n<td>150g</td>\r\n<td>4g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\r\n<td>3 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(60/240)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 4, misfire 1</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Musket</td>\r\n<td>300g</td>\r\n<td>5g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d12 piercing</td>\r\n<td>10 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(120/480)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 2</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Pepperbox</td>\r\n<td>250g</td>\r\n<td>4g (20)</td>\r\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\r\n<td>5 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(80/320)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 6, misfire 2</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Blunderbuss</td>\r\n<td>300g</td>\r\n<td>5g (5)</td>\r\n<td>2d8 piercing</td>\r\n<td>10 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(15/60)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 2</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Bad News</td>\r\n<td>Crafted</td>\r\n<td>10g (5)</td>\r\n<td>2d12 piercing</td>\r\n<td>25 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(200/800)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 3</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Hand Mortar</td>\r\n<td>Crafted</td>\r\n<td>10g (1)</td>\r\n<td>2d8 fire</td>\r\n<td>10 lb.</td>\r\n<td>(30/60)</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 3, explosive</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>","resultString":"","definitions":[]},{"id":40905,"componentId":null,"componentTypeId":null,"damageTypeId":null,"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you reach 7th level, you add your proficiency bonus to your initiative.

This is the sound of the sahuagin hunting horn &mdash; a call to raid and battle. Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as &ldquo;sea devils,&rdquo; for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Devils of the Deep.</strong></em> Sahuagin are a predatory, piscine race that ventures from the ocean&rsquo;s black depths to hunt the creatures of the shallows and shore. Though they dwell in the deepest trenches of the ocean, sahuagin view the entire aquatic realm as their kingdom and the creatures in it as blood sport for their hunting parties.</p>\r\n<p>The self-styled rulers of sahuagin ocean domains are massive mutant males that grow second sets of arms. They are terrible foes in battle, and all sahuagin bow down before these powerful barons.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Way of the Shark.</strong></em> Sahuagin worship the shark god Sekolah. Only female sahuagin are deemed worthy of channeling the god&rsquo;s power, and priestesses hold tremendous sway in sahuagin communities.</p>\r\n<p>Sahuagin are driven into a frenzy by the smell of fresh blood. As worshipers of Sekolah, they also have a special kinship with sharks, which they train as attack animals. Even untrained sharks recognize sahuagin as allies and don&rsquo;t prey on them.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Elven Enmity.</strong></em> The sahuagin might control the oceans if not for the presence of their mortal enemies, the aquatic elves. Wars between the two races have raged for centuries across the coasts and seas of the world, disrupting maritime trade and drawing other races into the bloody conflict.</p>\r\n<p>So intense is sahuagin hatred for the aquatic elves that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a malenti &mdash; a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way. Sahuagin are prone to mutation, but whether this rare phenomenon is a result of the wars between the sahuagin and the aquatic elves &mdash; or whether it preceded or even began the conflict &mdash; none can say.</p>\r\n<p>The sahuagin put the malenti to good use as spies and assassins in aquatic elf cities and the societies of other creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin. The mere shadow of the malenti threat incites paranoia and suspicion among aquatic elves, whose resilience is weakened as the prelude to an actual sahuagin invasion.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful Evil","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"Coastal, Underwater","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"Monster Manual pg

This is the sound of the sahuagin hunting horn &mdash; a call to raid and battle. Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as &ldquo;sea devils,&rdquo; for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Devils of the Deep.</strong></em> Sahuagin are a predatory, piscine race that ventures from the ocean&rsquo;s black depths to hunt the creatures of the shallows and shore. Though they dwell in the deepest trenches of the ocean, sahuagin view the entire aquatic realm as their kingdom and the creatures in it as blood sport for their hunting parties.</p>\r\n<p>The self-styled rulers of sahuagin ocean domains are massive mutant males that grow second sets of arms. They are terrible foes in battle, and all sahuagin bow down before these powerful barons.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Way of the Shark.</strong></em> Sahuagin worship the shark god Sekolah. Only female sahuagin are deemed worthy of channeling the god&rsquo;s power, and priestesses hold tremendous sway in sahuagin communities.</p>\r\n<p>Sahuagin are driven into a frenzy by the smell of fresh blood. As worshipers of Sekolah, they also have a special kinship with sharks, which they train as attack animals. Even untrained sharks recognize sahuagin as allies and don&rsquo;t prey on them.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Elven Enmity.</strong></em> The sahuagin might control the oceans if not for the presence of their mortal enemies, the aquatic elves. Wars between the two races have raged for centuries across the coasts and seas of the world, disrupting maritime trade and drawing other races into the bloody conflict.</p>\r\n<p>So intense is sahuagin hatred for the aquatic elves that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a malenti &mdash; a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way. Sahuagin are prone to mutation, but whether this rare phenomenon is a result of the wars between the sahuagin and the aquatic elves &mdash; or whether it preceded or even began the conflict &mdash; none can say.</p>\r\n<p>The sahuagin put the malenti to good use as spies and assassins in aquatic elf cities and the societies of other creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin. The mere shadow of the malenti threat incites paranoia and suspicion among aquatic elves, whose resilience is weakened as the prelude to an actual sahuagin

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.

If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.
